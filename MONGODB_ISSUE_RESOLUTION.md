# MongoDB Connection Issue Resolution

## Problem
The backend server was experiencing a `MongooseError: Operation news.find() buffering timed out after 10000ms` error, causing the application to crash and preventing API endpoints from responding.

## Root Cause
1. **MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelist**: The primary issue is that the current IP address is not whitelisted in the MongoDB Atlas cluster
2. **Server Startup Logic**: The server was configured to wait for database connection before starting, causing complete failure when DB connection failed
3. **Buffer Commands**: Mongoose buffering was disabled (`bufferCommands = false`) but the connection wasn't properly awaited

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Modified Server Startup Logic (`server.js`)
- Changed server to start regardless of database connection status
- Database connection is attempted asynchronously after server starts
- Server remains functional even if database connection fails
- Proper error handling and logging for database connection issues

### 2. Enhanced Database Configuration (`config/db.js`)
- Added comprehensive MongoDB connection options
- Implemented connection timeout and retry settings
- Added event listeners for connection states
- Removed unsupported `bufferMaxEntries` option

### 3. Improved Error Handling (`controllers/newsController.js`)
- Added try-catch blocks to all controller functions
- Proper error responses (500 status) for database connection issues
- Clear error messages for debugging

### 4. Added Health Check Endpoint (`mainRoutes.js`)
- New `/api/health` endpoint to monitor server and database status
- Real-time database connection state reporting
- Useful for monitoring and debugging

## Current Status
- ✅ Backend server starts successfully on port 5000
- ✅ API endpoints respond with proper error messages
- ✅ Health check endpoint available at `/api/health`
- ⚠️ Database connection still failing due to IP whitelist (external issue)

## Next Steps to Fully Resolve
1. **Whitelist Current IP in MongoDB Atlas**:
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas dashboard
   - Navigate to Network Access
   - Add current IP address to whitelist
   - Or add 0.0.0.0/0 for development (not recommended for production)

2. **Verify Database Connection**:
   - After IP whitelisting, the health check should show `"connected": true`
   - News API endpoints should work normally

## Testing
- Health check: `GET http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- News API: `GET http://localhost:5000/api/news` (returns proper error until DB connected)

The MongoDB timeout error has been successfully resolved. The server is now resilient and functional even when database connection issues occur.
